# Visa Co-Pilot 

Navigating the US visa landscape as an international student is complicated. I built this personal Visa Co-Pilot assistant to help answer common visa-related questions with relevant, up-to-date info straight from the official CMU OIE resources. At the same time, Iâ€™m using this as a hands-on learning opportunity to explore Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This co-pilot helps me save time, reduce confusion, and get quick, trustworthy answers when I need them most.
